## 📌 Overview

Predictive Incident Management System is an intelligent traffic operations platform designed to assist traffic authorities in analyzing incidents, predicting operational impact, estimating clearance times, assessing severity, and generating actionable response recommendations.

The platform combines Machine Learning, Geospatial Intelligence, Explainable AI (SHAP), Semantic Incident Retrieval (FAISS), and Decision Support Analytics to improve traffic incident response and resource allocation.

---

## 📈 Project Highlights

* Trained on 8,000+ traffic incident records
* Multi-model architecture using CatBoost
* Geospatial hotspot detection using DBSCAN
* SHAP-based explainability for transparent predictions
* Semantic historical incident retrieval using FAISS and SentenceTransformers
* End-to-end deployment with React, FastAPI, Render, and Vercel
* Operational decision-support recommendations
* What-if simulation engine

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Urban traffic management systems often rely on manual assessment of incidents such as:

* Vehicle Breakdowns
* Road Accidents
* Road Obstructions
* Flooding & Waterlogging
* Public Events
* Construction Activities

This can result in:

* Delayed response times
* Poor prioritization
* Increased congestion
* Inefficient resource allocation

This platform automates incident assessment and provides intelligent operational decision support.

## 🔍 Historical Incident Retrieval using FAISS

The platform incorporates Retrieval-Augmented Decision Support through FAISS.

### Workflow

1. Incident descriptions are converted into semantic embeddings using SentenceTransformers.
2. Embeddings are indexed using FAISS.
3. Incoming incidents are embedded and matched against historical incidents.
4. Similar incidents are retrieved to provide operational context and support decision-making.

### Technologies Used

* FAISS
* SentenceTransformers
* all-MiniLM-L6-v2

This enables the platform to leverage historical incident knowledge beyond structured machine learning predictions.

---

## 📍 Geospatial Intelligence

The platform performs:

* DBSCAN Hotspot Detection
* Traffic Density Mapping
* Spatial Risk Scoring
* Distance-Based Incident Assessment

to identify high-risk traffic zones and support operational planning.
